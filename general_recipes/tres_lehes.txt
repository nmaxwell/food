Tres Leches
Biscochuelo

5 eggs separated
1 cup sugar
1 cup flour
baking powder
vanilla
Beat egg whites until they're fluffy, then mix in the rest of the 
ingredients. Bake 15 min at 350 in a glass mold (buttered and with flour).

Leches
1 can evaporated milk
1 can condensed milk
1 can heavy cream ( mom says ONLY NESTLE lest you anger the tres leches monster)

Mix the leches in a blender and pour over the biscochuelo while its still 
warm and happy.
Let it cool down and then leave it overnight in the fridge.

Frost
Beat 2 egg whites until fluffy, with 1/4 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar. Spread 
over the tres leches. You can leave it like that but if you dont like egg 
tatar then broil the top of the tres leches for a few seconds so the eggs 
get a bit tanned. Caramel strings on top also look pretty if you do them 
carefully.

for the frosting do this: beat the egg whites until fluffly and then boil
the sugar and water until it makes strings. then beat in the syrup in the
egg whites and thats the frosting. my mom said if you just add the sugar to
the eggs they wont dissolve. smart mom. i didnt understand the recipe.
